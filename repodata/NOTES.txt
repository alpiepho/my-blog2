This is a simple utilty to build the post "github-summary.mdx".  It uses node and axois.

One wierd thing is the stdout contains the node command line.  Please use something
like the following to avoid the problem:

npm start  | grep -e '^>' -v > ../content/posts/github-summary.md

Another current issues is a rate limit on the github api.  Currently this is 60/hr
without any authentication.  When athentication is implmented, this should go up to
5000/hr.
