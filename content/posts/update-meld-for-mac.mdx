After I posted this blog, I also included my work around link as github issue
for the Mac-for-Meld project.  The issue is [here](https://github.com/yousseb/meld/issues/93)

Fortunately, something got the developers attention and he made a fix and
updated the build instructions.

I haven't tried the [release](https://github.com/yousseb/meld/releases/tag/osx-16) or the
new build instructions.  Soon :)
