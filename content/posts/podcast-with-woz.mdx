Another recent podcast from [Command Line Heros](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)
included a great interview with "The Woz", Steve Wozniac.

I found this so inspiring.  Even after decades, you can hear the excitement in his
voice about desiging computers.

I will post this to LinkedIn when the episode becomes available online.
