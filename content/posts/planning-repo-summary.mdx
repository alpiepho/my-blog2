title: Planning Repo Summary

description: "How to summarize my Github repos"
---

To go along with my post that summarizes all my LinkedIn posts, I want to add a post to
summarize all my Github repos.  Why?  Because I'm sitting at 114 repos, including 20 forks.

I really need to do this summary because I have forgotten many of them.  Also, the web UI for 
Github doesn't let you list all repos with out paging.

I see 2 options as a starting point:

- write a Puppeteer script to web-scrape the data
- use a Github api to gather details

A quick look for the Github api, I found that I can send:

[https://api.github.com/users/alpiepho/repos?per_page=1&page=2](https://api.github.com/users/alpiepho/repos?per_page=1&page=2)


And get json data for each of my repos.  I think I can use that get to the README.md file, like:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alpiepho/any-counter/master/README.md

As much fun as it would be to create a Puppeteer script, it looks like it will be better to create
a simple python script that parse the Github api data.

The [reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8713596/how-to-retrieve-the-list-of-all-github-repositories-of-a-person) 
I found with details about the Github api, also describes using tokens.  Might need that.

Looks like is time to give up {} and ;'s for awhile :smile:


**DANG:** looks like my emoji's are failing.  so :disappointed:
