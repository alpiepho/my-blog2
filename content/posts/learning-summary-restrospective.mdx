title: LinkedIn Completed Courses - Retrospective

The blog post [LinkedIn Completed Courses](learning-summary) was generated by another
applications, [pup-learning](https://github.com/alpiepho/pup-learning), that uses
the Javascript library from Google to crawl web pages.

### Background

pup-learning is the 3rd or 4th similar tool I have written, leveraging one to the
next.  This version was designed to be run manually (by a developer) to crawl the
pages of the LinkedIn Learning site and gather information from the Completed
Courses list.  That information is saved as a json file and further processed to 
generate a couple artifacts: 

1) the markdown file that became the blog post that
summarizes the LinkedIn courses I have taken, and 

2) a simple HTML file that is
published on Github pages [here](https://alpiepho.github.io/pup-learning/).

So why use Puppeteer?  Because it is fun to learn how to crawl web pages.  I want
to get better at this.  I can see future opportunites either in a job or a 
business with the skills to crawl web pages.


### Results

So was it worth it?  I'm a little mixed on this.  On one hand it is nice to have
all the courses (It's a pain navigating thru those pages).  The downside, is the
code feels "messy" because there was a lot of experimenting trying to get the 
details parsing working.  In order to produce the summary blog, I had to compromise,
and design in a HACK to limit number of details parsed each time the app is run
(making the code more complicated)


Getting better at:
- CSS selectors
- Javascript
- Json data
- Know which data I want to gather
- Github Actions

Still need help:
- Need to improve page parsing without need to colate pieces (should clean up code)
- Need to better understand core of Puppeteer when getting pages
- Would like to fix browser_get_filtered method (avoid limits and exceptions)
- How to produce better looking HTML


### Next Steps

- fix limits and exceptions
- gather more details for each class (TOC with times, expercise files, ??)
- Leverage pup-learning to another Puppeteer application to gather all the Lynda.com courses I watched before signing up for LinkedIn Premium
- Create GH Action to run the tool periodically
- Leverage pup-learning to another Puppeteer application to gather details on Github itself (API is limited)
