I wanted to experiment with [Gatsby Theme Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-theme-blog/)
and see if I could port my [First Blog](https://alpiepho.github.io/my-blog/), and how hard it would
be.

I was able to build a simple node.js script to convert the data from the First Blog to a form that
is used by the Gatsby Theme Blog.  It was fairly straightforward, with some image files renaming (since
the new format is flatter), and conversion of the date string (I had expanded from date to date+time...
can't see how to do that here yet).

Also, getting images to work was a littl tricky with adding npm packages and configs:
   - "gatsby-image": "^2.2.17",
   - "gatsby-transformer-remark": "^2.6.21",
   - "gatsby-transformer-sharp": "^2.2.13",

And some changes to gatsby-config.js:
```
  plugins: [
...
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
      options: {
        plugins: [
          {
            resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
            options: {
              maxWidth: 590,
            },
          },


        ],
      },
    },
    `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,
    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,
...
```
(I confess, I copied that from my previous blog, and didn't just know how to configure those
plug ins)

Now I just need to add GH Pages deploy and test it.

## TODO
- convert date to date+time
