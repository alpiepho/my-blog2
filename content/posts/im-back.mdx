I realized that I have let my blog linger for several months (since October 2019).  So much has changed.

With any luck, I will be adding entries for various LinkedIn posts I have made since October, as well
as entries for the LinkedIn Learning classes I have completed...My total is > 100 since last summer.

A couple other topics in the near future:

- Frustration with Gastby warnings
- My attempt ot clear GitHub warnings
- Why I dislike warnings of any kind
- How I moved this site to GitHub Actions for CI/CD 

Closing with a "Dad joke"..."Why was Tiger looking in toilet?"


"He was looking for Pooh".
