description: "How my Sites Linked and other TODOs"
---

I was updating linked and realized I needed to update my portfolio, and my blog, and my
online resume, and...

Ok, getting a little out of hand, so I'm going to write about how they are linked.
This entry is really for my own sanity.

### Which Links to Which

The following table lists a number of repos/sites and if they have a link to something else.

<table>
  <tr> 
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;"> </td>    
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;">LinkedIn</td>  
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;">Res(Docs)</td>  
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;">Res(Github)</td> 
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;">Res(Pages)</td>  
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;">Port3</td>  
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;">Blog2</td>  
    <td style="transform: rotate(-60deg); padding: 20px 0px 30px 0px;">Learning</td>  
  </tr>
  <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">LinkedIn</td>                <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td>x</td>  <td>x</td>  <td> </td>  </tr>
  <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">Resume (Google Docs)</td>    <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  </tr>
  <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">Resume (Github)</td>         <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  </tr>
  <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">Resume (GH Pages)</td>       <td>x</td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td>x</td>  <td>x</td>  <td>x</td>  </tr>
  <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">Portfolio3 (GH Pages)</td>   <td>x</td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td>x</td>  <td> </td>  <td>x</td>  <td>x</td>  </tr>
  <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">Blog2 (GH Pages)</td>        <td>x</td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td>x</td>  <td>x</td>  <td> </td>  <td>x</td>  </tr>
  <tr> <td style="white-space: nowrap;">pup-learning (GH Pages)</td> <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  <td> </td>  </tr>
</table>


The details on LinkedIn is nearly identical to my Resume.

I keep the "source" of my resume as a Google Doc, and when I update, I export to .pdf/.docx, then commit those to a GHitHub repo.

I also sync the details of my resume with "css-grid-resume-mine", a repo with a GH Page.  This site allows for more dynamic content and
can format for a printer or a PDF (thru the magic of CSS, the format is changed slightly for printing).  Oh, and check out
the "fun" I recently added.

My portfolio of projects, has undergone several transformations.  Currently it is is Jekyll, portfolio3.  It will probably move to Gatsby soon.

My Blog is on round two, "my-blog2", and is based on a Gatsby template.

"pup-learning" is a new GH Page that is the formated output of Puppeteer running over the LinkedIn Learning site, to gather the list of courses
I completed.  The raw json file is converted to a .mdx file I copy to "my-blog2", and a index.html that is auto-deployed with GH Actions
as pup-lerarning.  (my "css-grid-resume-mine" links to this).

Ok, that was even more confusing, but it should be a reminder to myself.



### Changing Information

I also want to keep track of the fact that if the details of my resume change, there are several
places that need to be updated:

- LinkedIn
- Resume (Google Docs)
- Resume (Github)
- Resume (GH Pages)
- Portfolio3 (GH Pages)
- Glassdoor
- I swear there was anothe job Sites

Dang, I really should automate that somehow.

### More Related Changes I should Make

1) ~~port "repodata" (in my-blog2) to a new repo and GH Page~~

2) ~~Export podcast list from Overcast, parse it, and generate new GH Page with list of podcasts...and link it ot every thing~~ :smiley: 

3) Parse my 40 page Google Doc with saved links...that I promised myself I would get back to. :cry:

### And even more ideas

- ~~Blog about QR code and fun~~
- Write my only version of https://tagcrowd.com/
- Write my own version of Jobscan
- Try Ansible (<i>**in progress**</i>)
- ~~Install Tinkercad~~
- investigate GH Action with Arduino
- Create D3 bubble chart for AWS products
- Expand node-repodata (like generate HTML and refactor, see TODO)
- ~~Start node-overcast-rss~~
- Add side links for lists (learning, lynda, podcasts etc)
- Personal password manager (where to store)


:star: I promise I will come back to this list with ~~strikethrus~~.
