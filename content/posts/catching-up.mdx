Where did the last 8 months go?

Since last June, GitHub came out with their special Github profile page.  I have added my own version with links to the various lists I keep.  Lists of courses taken, list of Github repos, etc.  These are the most current 
versions of many I have described in this blog.

Another update - I am dropping the prommised css-grid series.  Just don't have the time.

I have continued to re-post various things I find interesting [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/al-piepho-fw-sw-engineer/).

So where do I go from here?  I hope to do a better of job of posting here.  I'm told that practicing writing is good for me :)
