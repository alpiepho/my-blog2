The last Fort Collins Coders Meetup introduced 'Flutter' as Google sponsored 
framework to build mobile applications.

[Here](https://github.com/alpiepho/any_counter_flutter) is the repo for
the project I started.

The initial UI was easy since it was basically Google Material UI like the
any-counter application.

I got sided tracked.  Next steps are to re-factor UI into components, and
add the counting engine from the original React code.
