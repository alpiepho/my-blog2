I had my first taste of cloud computing in early 2018, specifically with Microsoft Azure.  
At the time, and several times since, I have looked at AWS, but walked away after being 
overwhelmed.

After being locked down for a few weeks, I decided to attend a couple virtual conferences, 
including AWS Summit….hosted in New Zealand.  I guess I could have waited for a US based 
session, but it was kind of cool seeing comments from all over NZ and Australia.   In the 
end, I had to watch most of the sessions as recorded videos, so it lost some luster.

Despite the setbacks, that Summit inspired me to start the AWS Training courses 
online.  Again, this is daunting, with hundreds of courses and video and no specific 
path to take.   And, I came to find out, the online courses that are free and kind of a 
loss-leader to 3rd 
party paid courses (around $2000 each)...all in preparation for the Certificate tests (at 
$150 each round...a bargain).  

I almost dropped these, because of the time and possible money commitment.  Aslo a little 
afraid of run-away costs if I start experimenting with services.   I finally decided to 
stay with them.  I have completed 37 courses so far, although what they call a course 
doesn’t always line up with the nice little email I get.

Why stick with it?  Even though the product names and other terms are confusing, I have 
found that some of the info is sticking.  More importantly, I am starting to understand 
how Amazon, the culture, seems to work.  I think alot of company values are reflected 
in how they name things, how the offer guidance, and how they add to their product 
portfolio.  

The best way I can describe Amazon product development is by comparing them to 
Amway.  Amway was known for having their own version of almost any product on the market.  
AWS is similar. 

 When the industry builds a product, say MongoDB for example.  
AWS either buys it, uses the open source, or builds their own version.  It also 
gets tightly integrated with other key services like IAM security or CloudWatch.  
Overall, AWS is a great set of secure and reliable product offerings...but it’s 
not free.  If AWS builds products like Amway, they set prices like Apple...they 
know how to set their prices and entice users to upscale.

I plan on continuing my learning of AWS, both thru AWS and LinkedIn Learning 
(the handful of courses in LinkedIn offer a different perspective).  There is 
no possible way to “complete” AWS training...too many.  However, I am still 
finding I am learning a lot about cloud computing.  For example, I just started 
the IOT courses.  Very interesting to compare the AWS way vs what I saw in Azure.

I also need to plan out and implement a couple representative projects with AWS 
services.  I have been trying to reason why I am doing this.  Genuine interest 
in AWS?  Means to learn cloud computing?  Position myself for a career pivot?  
Just want to learn? Maybe that answer will appear some day. :crystal_ball:
