I did go down the path to use the Github api to gather a bunch of json data that
described all the repos in my account.

I wound up creating a small node.js app using axios to call the api several times because
the api had a limit on number of items per page.

I also hit a problem using the api to get details about repos marked private.  I never did get
that working and manually created a file, private.json, to carry that data.  In the end I 
decided not to list the private repos.

This effort was good, because it forced me to review my-then 114 repos (including 20 forks).  I was
able to remove some forks, and moved a lot of old/stale items to private....so it only clutters
up my view.

One idea that came of this effort, is that I want to design a Github hosted page that use 
Github actions to generate a better landing page, then I can pin that single page and re-direct
people there.  Then I can add features:

- List ALL repos, instead of the forced paging
- allow sorting
- Tweek the activity graph
- Add any other details I think are cool

Unfortunately, I think I need to look into the missing emoji's first...:sadface:
