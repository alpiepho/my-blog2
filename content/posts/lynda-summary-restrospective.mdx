title: Lynda.com Completed Courses - Retrospective

description: "Story behind the Lynda.com Completed Courses blog entry"

The blog post [Lynda.com Completed Courses](../lynda-summary) was generated by another
applications, [pup-lynda](https://github.com/alpiepho/pup-lynda), that uses
the Javascript library **Puppeteer** from Google to crawl web pages.

### Background

pup-lynda is highly leveraged from pup-learnng repo.  The Lynda.com site is the
earlier version of LinkedIn learning, geared toward free used by public libraries
etc.  Parsing this site was very similar to the Learning site.


### Results

It was worth building this to complete the generation of various summaries.  It is
unlikely I will ever need to update the tool or the post.

This spinoff project did let me figure out one aspect of using Puppeteer that had
previously escaped me.  I could never grasp why the async code within a "page.evaluate"
call was so different from the rest of the Puppeteer code.  As [this](https://blog.bitsrc.io/web-scraping-with-puppeteer-e73e5fee7474) blog post
explains, the code sent to "page.evaluate" is run by the browser itself, not the
Node.js application running with Puppeteer.  This is explains why most implementations
use statements like "document.querySelectorAll".  

Reference for Puppeteer is [here](https://pptr.dev/).

Reference for the internal parsing, ie Web API, is [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API)


### Next Steps

- port some of the refactor, better parsing back to pup-learning
- work on the "Next Steps" of the [Learning Retro](/learning-summary-restrospective.mdx) page.
- (ok, gotta throw in some emojis...:smile: and :rocket: and :chicken:...wasn't sure that was going to show up)
- maybe I should fix the lynda-summary post.
