I really love the Linux tool 'Meld' to compare files and directories.  There is a port
to Mac that I rely on...I'm almost crippled without it :)

Unfortunately, the past upgrade of Mac OS has caused an ugly interaction whn closing
Meld.

The problem is related how the app is closed. If you use the Menu option, the saved 
state is removed cleaning. If you close using the window close (read circle), the saved 
state remains. Somehow, when this there, the application will not open from command line.
Sometimes it will open, but you need to manually switch to the Meld application from the tool bar.

I have cobbled together a workaround, described [here](https://gist.github.com/alpiepho/20f07bf5365bc2617fcf8594b9e4a7f2).


Someday, I would love to convert it to Javascript and build a VS Code plugin.  
Maybe I'm too much of a geek, but that would be super-useful for me.
