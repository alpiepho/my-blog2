In the last 6 months Github relased a feature called "Actions" that lets developers script the deploy steps
triggered by actions like commiting to a Github repo.

I found an example "action" to automate the deploy of a Gatsby web application to a Github page...and tried 
if for this blog site.  Here is the [action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gatsby-publish).

The commit for blog entry **should** trigger the automated deploy of the site.

Here we go...
