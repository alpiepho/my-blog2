title: CSS Grid Resume - Part 0

description: "Learning by Creating a Resume Site - Part 0"
---

This is the start of a series of blog entries that will document all the steps needed 
for a non-programmer to go from zero to a simple website that hosts a persons resume.

This will start before the person even has a GitHub account, and work thru all the 
steps needed to create the account, fork a project, change it and even use GitHub Actions
to auto deploy the site.  All Free.

Why am I writing this?  It seems like a great opportunity to explain all of these ideas.
These are all steps I have taken over the years.  My own learning was spread over dozens
of projects, but I can see them all in this project.  When I first started the [css-grid-resume](https://github.com/alpiepho/css-grid-resume)
project, I had aspirations of sharing it.  Then I realized that it might be a stretch 
for the people I think could use it the most.  As I thought more about what a person would
need to know to use css-grid-resume, I realized that it would require starting from
from ground zero.

I admit, having my own resume, [here](https://alpiepho.github.io/css-grid-resume-mine/) with 
[github](https://github.com/alpiepho/css-grid-resume-mine),
on line hasn't really gotten me a job, but I haven't really made it public.  However, I am
proud of the skills I have used and learned to create it.

When this is complete, I hope to roll this into a single post on Linked to share the 
various things that can be learned from this seemingly simple project.



### What Are the Steps

I plan on describing the following steps.  Readers are encouraged to skip any steps they want,
since every person will be at a different point in learning.

    - with python -m SimpleHTTServer
    - other ways

### The Future

As I finish up this blog post, I truely hope I can pull it off.  Even if I never get around 
posting to LinkedIn, I just want to finish this for myself and that random person who might
stumble on my blog.  :smile:
