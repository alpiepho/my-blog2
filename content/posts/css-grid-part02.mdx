## Why HTML/CSS

A little history.

The css-grid-resume project was started as a simple learning application.  
Simple, because it doesn’t rely on any large web framework, just HTML and CSS.  
I also wanted a clean project to better learn css grid, and responsive design.

With a basic, responsive page created, I wanted a way to showcase the page instead of 
instructing people to open it locally.  Github has a great feature called Github Pages. 
Pages lets you server a static web stie directly from Github...you don’t need to pay for a 
server.  Deploying to GH Pages is as easy as creating a new branch (‘gh_pages’) and 
pushing that to Github.

As the project evolved, it seemed like a good idea to add a little more interaction.  
Apline.js is a lightweight Javascript framework that provides the simple Menu system.

Shortly before taking on this project, I was experimenting with PWAs (Progressive Web 
Applications) and the Google Chrome audit tool “Lighthouse”.  Lighthouse is built 
into Chrome and can be used to analyze a web page for various performance scores.  
As one who thrives of completeness, I pounded thru fixing all the reported 
problems....as I got to the last fix, I managed to get all 100’s...and discovered 
a cool easter egg (fireworks).  I have kind of got hooked on that easter egg, and 
have tried to get most of my small sites to that level (grrr, just realized 
css-grid-resume is not quite there :frowning: )

Finally, I learned of a new Github feature, Github Actions.  Actions lets you 
automate many aspects related to CI/CD for a project in Github.  I have css-grid-resume 
setup to auto deploy to Github Pages when I push any changes.  At first, I thought it 
was kind of a gimmick, but now I realize how much I rely on that feature.

I’ve given you a taste of Github.  Next part will go into more details of git and Github.
