I recently added a couple new “features” to my online resume, css-grid-resume-mine.

I dawned on me that with the Menu options I could add some other features.  

The first was to add a QR code.  These work great for passing a website to someone with a cell phone.  The user just needs to point their phone camera at the code.  I can envision showing some my resume site and showing the QR code so they can pull up the site without keying in the URL.  I used an online free site to convert the GH Pages url to a QR code (https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) then saved the image in the project.

The second thing added was a little “fun” app I had previously worked in as a CodePen.  It is something cool in pure CSS and HTML, with NO Javascript.  It is a fun little project, but I didn’t want to carry over the full CodePen site.  It turns out that CodePen does all the parsing of CSS etc., on their serve, then presents the results in an iframe….really a whole web page embedded in a pane of the Code Pen site.  Using the Chrome developer tools, I was able to “Copy Outer HTML” for that iframe, and save it to a local .html file.  Everything needed for the site (at least, without Javascript) just runs.  It was trivial to hook this up to a button in the Menu.

As I write this, I can think of a couple other things to do:
Add link back to CodePen for fun
Or add a ‘credits’ menu option with link
Add QR as second page when printed

I started the css-grid-resume as an experiment and learning too for CSS grid.  (I understand it better, but it’s still not entirely clear).  Adding in a simple Javascript Menu with Apline.js, has made that simple page a lot more useful.
