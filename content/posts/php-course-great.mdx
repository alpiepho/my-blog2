title: This PHP Course is Great...

From my last post: "A recent job posting and a recent dive into Wordpress has 'inspired'
me to look at PHP."

I started a course on LinkedIn Learning ( [PHP with MySql Essential Training 1: The Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/php-with-mysql-essential-training-1-the-basics) ).  This really starts from the beginning.

As I worked thru this course and the follow up ( [PHP with MySql Essential Training 2: Build a CMS](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/php-with-mysql-essential-training-2-build-a-cms)) I have said to my self "Wow! That's how that thing works.".

As I sit back and think about it, it makes sense that a course that
teaches a language that really started the web.  The instructor
has been great about explaining the details (currently on Cookies and Authentication...2 areas that are heavliy abstracted in other
frameworks.)

I also find the historical story interesting and what TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms) mean:

- PHP - Personal Home Page (original name)
- PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (recursive, renamed around version 3)

For my own reference, I have created my own repo with the course
example code: [globe bank php sql example](https://github.com/alpiepho/globe_bank_php_sql_example)

I really didn't think learning a little about PHP could teach 
me other basics of the web.
