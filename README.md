## My Blog2

This was generated from the Gatsby starter project [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog-theme.git).   This is a Gatsby starter for the new theme idea and [Gatsby-Theme-Blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-theme-blog/).

It also uses the gh-pages npm package to allow for easy deploy to GitHhub.

You can access my blog directly [here](https://alpiepho.github.io/my-blog2/).

Thanks for taking a look - Al
